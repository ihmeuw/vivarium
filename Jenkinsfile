/* This Jenkinsfile simply loads the `reusable_pipeline` pipeline from the
vivariu_build_utils repository (https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_build_utils).

vivarium_build_utils is loaded as a Jenkins shared library (https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/).
Jenkins shared library convention dictates that importable modules must be stored
in the 'vars' folder.

Jenkins shared libraries can be configured in the Jenkins UI:
* Manage Jenkins
  * Configure System
    * Global Pipeline Libraries section
      * Library subsection
        * Name: The Name for the lib
        * Version: The branch you want to use. Throws an error
                   for nonexistent branches.
        * Project Repository: Url to the shared lib
        * Credentials: SSH key to access the repo
