"""
============================
The Vivarium Event Framework
============================

``vivarium`` constructs and manages the flow of :ref:`time <time_concept>`
through the emission of regularly scheduled events. The tools in this module
manage the relationships between event emitters and listeners and provide
an interface for user :ref:`components <components_concept>` to register
themselves as emitters or listeners to particular events.

The :class:`EventManager` maintains a mapping between event types and channels.
Each event type (and event types must be unique so event type is equivalent to
event name, e.g., ``time_step_prepare``) corresponds to an
:class:`EventChannel`, which tracks listeners to that event in prioritized
levels and passes on the event to those listeners when emitted.

The :class:`EventInterface` is exposed off the :ref:`builder <builder_concept>`
and provides two methods: :func:`get_emitter <EventInterface.get_emitter>`,
which returns a callable emitter for the given event type and
:func:`register_listener <EventInterface.register_listener>`, which adds the
given listener to the event channel for the given event. This is the only part
of the event framework with which client code should interact.

For more information, see the associated event
:ref:`concept note <event_concept>`.
