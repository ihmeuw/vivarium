:mod:`vivarium` constructs and manages the flow of :ref:`time <time_concept>`
through the emission of regularly scheduled events. This event system provides
a means of coordinating across various components in a simulation.

What is an Event?
-----------------

An :class:`Event <vivarium.framework.event.Event>` is a simple container for a
group of attributes that provide all the necessary information to respond to
the event.  Events have the following attributes:

.. list-table:: **Event Attributes**
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20, 60

   * - Name
     - Description
   * - | index
     - | An index into the population table that contains all
       | individuals that may respond to the event.
   * - | time
     - | The time at which the event will resolve.  The current simulation
       | time plus the size of the current time step.
   * - | step_size
     - | A :class:`~pandas.Timedelta` or :class:`int` representing the
       | size of the next simulation time step.
   * - | user_data
     - | A :class:`dict` that allows an event emitter to pass arbitrary
       | information to event listeners.

:mod:`vivarium` manages these events with a publication-subscriber system.  The
framework maintains several named event channels where it and user
:ref:`components <components_concept>` can emit (or publish) events.  User
components may then register methods or functions as *listeners* (or
subscribers) to events on a particular channel.  The *listeners* will then be
called any time an event is emitted on the channel and will receive the event
as an argument.

User components can also create new event channels simply by requesting an
*emitter* or *listener* from the event system.  This behavior is discouraged,
however, as it makes understanding the structure of a model much more
difficult.


Lifecycle Events
----------------

The simulation engine itself is responsible for the emission of a dedicated set
of events that determine the progression of time in the simulation. Each time
step in the simulation corresponds to the emission of a set of ``time_step``
events. :ref:`Components <components_concept>` can register themselves as
listeners to these events and thus take action on each time step or other
key simulation phase.

The following table depicts the events emitted by the simulation engine itself
and the lifecycle phase when they are emitted. See the
:ref:`lifecycle concept note <lifecycle_concept>` for more information about
these phases.

.. list-table:: **Events Emitted by the Simulation Engine**
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30, 40

   *   - Lifecycle Phase
       - Events
   *   - | Post-setup
       - | ``post_setup``
   *   - | Main Event Loop
       - | ``time_step_prepare``
         | ``time_step``
         | ``time_step__cleanup``
         | ``collect_metrics``
   *   - | Finalization
       - | ``simulation_end``


Interacting with Events
-----------------------

The :class:`EventInterface <vivarium.framework.event.EventInterface>` is
available off the :ref:`Builder <builder_concept>` and provides two options for
interacting with the event system:

1. :func:`register_listener <vivarium.framework.event.EventInterface.register_listener()>` to add a
listener to a given event to be called on emission

2. :func:`get_emitter <vivarium.framework.event.EventInterface.get_emitter()>`
to retrieve a callable emitter for a given event

Although methods for both getting emitters and registering listeners are
provided, it is strongly encouraged that only the registering listeners aspect
is used.


Registering Listeners
+++++++++++++++++++++

In order to register a listener to an event to respond when that event is
emitted, we can use the
:func:`register_listener <vivarium.framework.event.EventInterface.register_listener()>`. The listener
itself should be a callable function that takes as its only argument
the :class:`Event <vivarium.framework.event.Event>` that is emitted.

Suppose we wish to track how many simulants are affected each time step. We
could do this by creating an observer component with an ``on_time_step`` method
that we will register as a listener for the ``time_step`` event. Our component
would look something like the following:

.. code-block:: python

   class AffectedObserver:

       def setup(self, builder):
           self.affected_counts = pd.DataFrame(columns=['time_step', 'number_affected])
           builder.event.register_listener('time_step', self.on_time_step)

       def on_time_step(self, event):
           self.affected_counts.append(pd.DataFrame({'time_step': event.time, 'number_affected': len(event.index)}))

On each time step, our ``on_time_step`` method will be called and we will add
another row to our dataframe tracking the number of affected simulants.

.. note::

   Listeners are stored in priority levels when registered to an event.
   These levels (0-9) indicate which order listeners should be called when the
   event is emitted; listeners in lower priority levels will be called earlier.
   Within a priority level, there is no guarantee of order.

   **This feature should be avoided if possible.** Components should strive to
   obey the Markov property as they transform the state table: the state of the
   simulation at the beginning of the next time step should only depend on the
   current state of the system.


Emitting Events
+++++++++++++++

The :func:`get_emitter <vivarium.framework.event.EventInterface.get_emitter()>`
provides a way to get a callable emitter for a given named event. It can be
used as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   emitter = builder.event.get_emitter('my_event')

.. danger::

   Do not emit any of the simulation lifecyle events described in the table
   above. These are events that correspond to particular phases in the
   simulation and should only be emitted by the engine itself.

.. caution::

   While users may provide their own named events by requesting an emitter,
   this is not advised. Adding additional events beyond those emitted by the
   simulation engine essentially creates arbitrary ``GOTO`` statements in the
   simulation flow and makes time much more difficult to think about.
