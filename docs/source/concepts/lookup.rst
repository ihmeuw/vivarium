Lookup Tables
=============

Simulations tend to require a large quantity of data to run.  A completely
reasonable way to look at a simulation is to think of it as a task of
getting the right data and the right random numbers in the appropriate
place at the appropriate time.  To address the first concern,
:mod:`vivarium` provides the
:class:`Lookup Table <vivarium.framework.lookup.LookupTable>` abstraction
to ensure that the right data can be retrieved when it's needed. In
particular, it attempts to wrap different strategies for constructing
interpolations or distributions on data such that a user simply needs to
request values for a set of simulants when they're needed. This idea is
extended to compositions of of several data-based values by :mod:`vivarium`'s
:ref:`values system <values_concept>`.

The Lookup Table
----------------

A :class:`Lookup Table <vivarium.framework.lookup.LookupTable>`
for a quantity is a callable object that is built from
a scalar value or a :class:`pandas.DataFrame` of data points that describes
how the quantity varies with other variable(s). It is called with a
:class:`pandas.Index` as a function parameter which represents a simulated
population as discussed in the :ref:`population concept <population_concept>`.
When called, the :class:`Lookup Table <vivarium.framework.lookup.LookupTable>`
simply returns appropriate values of the quantity for the population it was
passed, interpolating if necessary or extrapolating if configured to. This
behavior represents the standard interface for asking for data about a
population in a simulation.

The lookup table system is built in layers. At the top is the
:class:`Lookup Table <vivarium.framework.lookup.LookupTable>` object which
is responsible for providing a uniform interface to the user regardless
of the underlying implementation. From the user's perspective, it takes in
a data set or scalar value on initialization and then lets them query against
that data with a population index.

The next layer is selected at initialization time based on the type of data
provided. The :class:`Lookup Table <vivarium.framework.lookup.LookupTable>`
picks either a :class:`ScalarTable <vivarium.framework.lookup.ScalarTable>`
if a single value is provided as the data or a
:class:`InterpolatedTable <vivarium.framework.lookup.InterpolatedTable>` if
a :class:`pandas.DataFrame` is provided as the data.

.. note::

   The :class:`InterpolatedTable <vivarium.framework.lookup.InterpolatedTable>`
   is a misnomer here. It confuses the data handling strategy with the
   underlying data representation.  A better name would be ``BinnedDataTable``
   to indicate that it wraps data where the continuous parameters are
   represented by bin edges in the provided data.  This would allow us
   to easily think about and extend the lookup system to wrap data where the
   continuous parameters are represented by points and to tables where all
   parameters are categorical.

If the underlying data is a single value, this is the last layer of
abstraction. The :class:`ScalarTable <vivarium.framework.lookup.ScalarTable>`
has only one reasonable strategy which is to broadcast the value over
the population index.  If we have a :class:`pandas.DataFrame` and therefore an
:class:`InterpolatedTable <vivarium.framework.lookup.InterpolatedTable>`,
there are additional layers to the lookup system to allow the user to
control the strategy for turning the population index into values based on
the data.  The
:class:`InterpolatedTable <vivarium.framework.lookup.InterpolatedTable>`
is then responsible for turning the population index into a set of
attributes relevant to the value production based on the structure of
the input data and then providing those attributes to the value production
strategy.

.. note::

   I'm being careful with language here.  We have objects named
   ``Interpolation`` and ``InterpolatedTable`` though the operation they
   perform is actually disaggregation.  If we extend the system to
   work with point estimates for the continuous parameters, then
   interpolation would appropriately describe what we do.  Both are
   value production strategies based on the structure of the input data.

More information about the value production strategies can be found in
:ref:`here <interpolation_concept>`.

Construction Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lookup table is defined for a set of categorical variables, continuous
variables, and the values that depend on those variables. The lookup table
calls these variables keys, parameters, and values, respectively.

key
    A categorical variable, such as sex, that a quantity depends on.
parameter
    A continuous variable, such as age, that a quantity depends on. This data
    frequently represents bins for which values are defined.
value
    Known values of the quantity of interest, which vary with the keys and
    parameters.

Along with data about these variables, A lookup table is instantiated with the
corresponding column names which are used to query an internal
:class:`population view <vivarium.framework.population.population_view.PopulationView>`
when the table itself is called. This means the lookup table only needs to be
called with a population index -- it gathers the population information it
needs itself. It also means the data must be available in the
:term:`population state table <State Table>` with the same column name.

In the table below is an example of (unrealistic) data that could be
used to create a lookup table for a quantity of interest about a population,
in this case, Body Mass Index (BMI). We may find ourselves in a situation where
we want to know the BMI of a simulant in order to make a treatment decision.
If we construct a lookup table with these data, we can cleanly get the
information we want and go on implementing our treatment. When called, the
lookup table will return values of BMI for the simulants defined by the
population index.

Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is an example of creating and calling a lookup table in an
:ref:`interactive setting <interactive_tutorial>` using the data above. The
interface and process are the same when integrating a lookup table into a
:term:`component <Component>`, which is primarily how they are used. Assuming
you have a valid simulation object named ``sim`` and the data from the above
table in a :class:`pandas.DataFrame` named ``data``, you can construct a
lookup table in the following way, using the interface from the builder.

.. code-block:: python

      # value_columns implicitly set to remaining columns
    > bmi = sim.builder.lookup.build_table(data, key_columns=['sex'], parameter_columns=['age'])
    > population = sim.get_population()
    > bmi(population.index).head()  # returns BMI values for the population

      0     20.0
      1     20.0
      2     30.0
      3     27.0
      4     25.0
      Name: BMI, dtype: float64

.. note::

   Constructing a lookup table currently requires your data meet specific
   conditions. These are a consequence of the method the lookup table uses to
   arrive at the correct data. Specifically, your parameter columns must
   represent bins and they must overlap.

Estimating Unknown Values
-------------------------

Interpolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a lookup table was constructed with a scalar value or values, the lookup
call trivially returns the same scalar(s) back for any population passed in.
However, if the lookup table was instead created with a
:class:`pandas.DataFrame` of varying data the lookup will perform interpolation
which is an important feature. Interpolation is the process of estimating
values for unspecified parameters within the bounds of the parameters we have
defined in the lookup table. Currently, the most common case arises when the
values are binned by the parameters. Then, the interpolation simply finds the
correct bin a value belongs to. Please see the
:ref:`interpolation concept note <interpolation_concept>` for more in-depth
information about the kinds of interpolation performed by the lookup table.

Extrapolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, we discussed interpolation as the process of estimating data within
the bounds defined by our lookup table. What would happen if we wanted data
outside of this range? Estimating such data is called extrapolation, and it can
be performed using a lookup table as well. Extrapolation is a configurable
option that, when enabled, allows a lookup data to provide values outside of
the range it was created with. This is done by extending the edge points
outwards to encompass outside points.  This is a dumb but useful strategy
and is primarily used to run simulations beyond the time bounds
included in the data under the assumption that parameters do not change
in the future.

Specifying Options in the Model Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring interpolation and extrapolation in a model specification is
straightforward. Currently, the only acceptable value for order is `0`.
Extrapolation can be turned on and off.

.. code-block:: yaml

    configuration:
        interpolation:
            order: 0
            extrapolate: True
