Vivarium is a framework for microsimulation written using standard scientific Python tools.

You can install ``vivarium`` from PyPI with pip:

  ``> pip install vivarium``

or build it from source with

  ``> git clone https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium.git``

  ``> cd vivarium``

  ``> python setup.py install``

This will make the ``vivarium`` library available to python and install a command-line executable called ``simulate``
that you can use to verify your installation with

  ``> simulate test``
